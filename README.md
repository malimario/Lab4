Lab4 Code, Parts 2 and 3 PWM Cycles
This code is for Embedded Systems Lab 4 Parts 2 and 3 with Prof. Naher at Rowan University, for Section 3.
This code was written and executed by Miles Alimario.
Part 2 is a PWM cycle utilizing the ACLK with a 10% duty cycle with a period of 500ms.
Part 3 is a PWM cycle utilizing the ACLK with a 20% duty cycle with a period of 250ms.
An oscilloscope was used to verify the components of the signal, and the results can be found in the report submitted.
Thanks for the lesson!
